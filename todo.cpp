//Implement mining algorithm Apriori:


//Part 1:
	- Assign tasks to team members
	- Each team member explains how they plan to accomplish goals

//Part 2:
	- Implement Apriori & apply to titanic dataset
		- # of association rules w/ minimum support = 0.75
		- # of rules with confidence = 1
		- Support/Confidence of survival rate of 1st, 2nd, 3rd class children
		- Did children in 2nd class have better survival chance than 1st class children?
		- Did 1st & 2nd class children have better survival chance than 3rd class children?
		- Do you get more or less if lower minimum support val? Why?
		- Give example of a redundant rule
		- Present results with one slide per question (at least 2 slides for apriori algorithm)
		
//Part 3:
	- How to apply an algorithm similar to apriori but in the other direction?
